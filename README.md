# Radtel RT-890 Custom Firmware

This project is an effort to improve the firmware of the Radtel RT-890 in terms of features and radio performance.

It is based on [DualTachyon's OEFW](https://github.com/DualTachyon/radtel-rt-890-oefw) which is reversed from the original Radtel 1.34 firmware.  
Thanks to him for making this possible!

## Disclaimer
This firmware is a work in progress and could be unstable; it could alter your radio and its data.  
Use at your own risk and remember to back up your SPI memory before installing any custom firmware.

## Features
- All stock features (check user's manual)
- SSB reception
- Light theme
- AM Fix (improvement in AM reception with strong signals, port of @OneOfEleven's excellent work on the Quansheng UV-K5)
- And much more!

## Instructions
### SPI memory backup
Use [RT-890-Flasher](https://github.com/DualTachyon/radtel-rt-890-flasher)

### SPI memory restore
Use [RT-890-SPI-restore-CLI](https://github.com/DualTachyon/radtel-rt-890-spi-restore-cli)

### Customizations
```
UART_DEBUG          => UART debug output
MOTO_STARTUP_TONE   => Moto XPS startup beeps
ENABLE_AM_FIX       => Experimental port of the great UV-K5 AM fix from OneOfEleven
ENABLE_LTO          => Link Time Optimization
ENABLE_NOAA         => NOAA weather channels (always re-set the sidekeys actions from menu after modifying the available actions)
```

### Build & Flash

# Open reimplementation of the Radtel RT-890 v1.34 firmware

This repository is a preservation project of the Radtel RT-890 v1.34 firmware.
It is dedicated to understanding how the radio works and help developers making their own customisations/fixes/etc.
It is by no means fully understood or has all variables/functions properly named, as this is best effort only.
As a result, this repository will not include any customisations or improvements over the original firmware.

# Compiler

arm-none-eabi GCC version 10.3.1 is recommended, which is the current version on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS.
Other versions may generate a flash file that is too big.
You can get an appropriate version from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

# Building

To build the firmware, you need to fetch the submodules and then run make:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1
make
```

# Flashing

* Use the firmware.bin file with either [RT-890-Flasher](https://github.com/DualTachyon/radtel-rt-890-flasher) or [RT-890-Flasher-CLI](https://github.com/DualTachyon/radtel-rt-890-flasher-cli)
